# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Search-and-Replace challenge, Pig Latin challenge, DNA Pairing challenge, Missing Letters challenge

**Thoughts:** Must review String functions. Strings are immutable - look into this and see how exactly this limits you.

(Since these are small challenges, I won't post them all on github. When I get to the larger projects in a few more days they will go up here and maybe CodePen.)

### Day 2: April 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Boo Who challenge, Sorted Union challenge, Convert HTML entities challenge

**Thoughts:** Only 10 more challenges until the advanced scripting challenges.

### Day 3: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spinal Tap Case challenge, Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers challenge, Sum All Primes challenge started

**Thoughts:** I heart RegEx.

### Day 4: April 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sum All Primes challenge, Smallest Common Multiple challenge started

**Thoughts:** Lots of math proofs. Had to dust off that part of my brain.

### Day 5: April 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Smallest Common Multiple challenge continued

**Thoughts:** Completely rewrote the algorithm to be a little less convoluted. Spent a lot of time tracking down refactoring bugs from the rewrites. Basically going for finding the prime factorization of each number, folding lower prime multiples into whatever has the highest, then mutiplying all factors together to get the LCM. Lots of loops and array manipulation. Will continue work on it tomorrow.

### Day 6: April 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Smallest Common Multiple challenge continued

**Thoughts:** Prime factorization is working. Now I'm working on retaining only the highest quantities of each factor for multiplying to find the LCM. Switching from an array to a hash/object helps keep track of the factors and their quantities.

### Day 7: April 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Smallest Common Multiple challenge continued

**Thoughts:** Good lord, what a complicated mess. Mostly functional but having issues with translating from a hash property name to a 2D array value. Will probably move to an object for each number since the data to maintain is getting to be a juggling act without an object to encapsulate it all.

### Day 8: April 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Smallest Common Multiple challenge, Finders Keepers challenge

**Thoughts:** Finally beat the bear! Smallest common multiple is down. And the next challenge had literally a one-line solution.
