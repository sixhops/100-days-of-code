# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Search-and-Replace challenge, Pig Latin challenge, DNA Pairing challenge, Missing Letters challenge

**Thoughts:** Must review String functions. Strings are immutable - look into this and see how exactly this limits you.

(Since these are small challenges, I won't post them all on github. When I get to the larger projects in a few more days they will go up here and maybe CodePen.)

### Day 2: April 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Boo Who challenge, Sorted Union challenge, Convert HTML entities challenge

**Thoughts:** Only 10 more challenges until the advanced scripting challenges.

### Day 3: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spinal Tap Case challenge, Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers challenge, Sum All Primes challenge started

**Thoughts:** I heart RegEx.

### Day 4: April 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sum All Primes challenge, Smallest Common Multiple challenge started

**Thoughts:** Lots of math proofs. Had to dust off that part of my brain.

### Day 5: April 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Smallest Common Multiple challenge continued

**Thoughts:** Completely rewrote the algorithm to be a little less convoluted. Spent a lot of time tracking down refactoring bugs from the rewrites. Basically going for finding the prime factorization of each number, folding lower prime multiples into whatever has the highest, then mutiplying all factors together to get the LCM. Lots of loops and array manipulation. Will continue work on it tomorrow.
