# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Search-and-Replace challenge, Pig Latin challenge, DNA Pairing challenge, Missing Letters challenge

**Thoughts:** Must review String functions. Strings are immutable - look into this and see how exactly this limits you.

(Since these are small challenges, I won't post them all on github. When I get to the larger projects in a few more days they will go up here and maybe CodePen.)
